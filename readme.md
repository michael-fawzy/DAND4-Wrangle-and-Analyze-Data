## About

Gathered data from a variety of sources in a variety of formats then wrangled the data with Python and its libraries to analyze the tweets of a Twitter page.
-	Gathered data by manual download, programmatically using the Requests library, and by reading a text file line by line into a pandas DataFrame.
-	Assessed data visually and programmatically for quality and tidiness issues.
-	Cleaned the issues as appropriate resulting in a high quality and tidy master pandas DataFrame.
-	Analyzed the wrangled data and communicated the insights and visualizations produced.
